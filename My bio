Hey, so I'll introduce myself, list my tastes, what I like, my passions. In short, everything
Without further ado, let's get started!


My name is Komi (nickname) and I'm 15 years old
I am French and I live in France (in the south)
I am gay, my pronouns are : He/Him

I'm a nice person, who will never hesitate to help someone if it's necessary.
I am very (too) empathetic
I can get angry sometimes but it's very rare.
I have been having panic/anxiety attacks for 8 years
It's a pain, but I finally managed to control them.
I have autism spectrum disorder (difficulty communicating, socializing, dealing with noise or a highly stimulating environment, often repetitive movements, difficulty coordinating movements)
I have dyspraxia (clumsiness, difficulty learning new movements, difficulty writing and drawing)
I am hypersensitive

----------------------------------------------------------------

Favorite Movies / Series / Anime / Cartoon :

- The Iron Giant (watched three times and cried twice on all three lmao)
- Encanto (the movie is amazing, especially the music)
- My Hero Academia: World Heroes Mission (I almost screamed a few times because of the excitement, but since I was in the theater I couldn't)
- My Neighbor Totoro (Nice but nothing more)

- Stranger Things (please I want to go back in time to the release of Season 4, the hype on the networks was really incredible)
- Squid Game (it was actually really fun to watch)

- Hunter X Hunter (I watched it 4 times, please help me)
- My Hero Academia (Just the best anime of all time)
- Naruto (the classic, I didn't like Shippuden at all)
- Your Name (it's a bit messy with all those time travel stories, but otherwise it's a moving story)
- Assasination Classroom (I cried 70% of my body water at the end)
- Demon Slayer
- Beastars (I love the way the anime reflects our current society in many of its aspects)
- Detective Conan
- Soul Eater (Maka >>>>>)
- Nagatoro (Well, although the anime trivializes a bit the school bullying which is really not cool, despite everything it's still entertaining to watch)
- 7DS (only the first two seasons, I didn't watch the rest)

- Steven Universe (I just completely loved it, everything is beautiful: The music, the scenery, the colors, the animation. In short: perfection)
- Amphibia (It took me a while to get hooked, but now it's my favorite cartoon on par with Steven Universe. I love Amphibia very much and I identify myself with Marcy)
- The Owl House (It's really good, incredible animation.)
- Aggretsuko (I love it, but really)
- Panty And Stocking (It is really funny, the humor is good, the animation too)
